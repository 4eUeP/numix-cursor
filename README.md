# numix-cursor
An X-cursor-theme for use along with the numixproject products.

This is v0.1 and there is still a lot to discuss.

This theme is tested only under Ubuntu with the Unity desktop, but should work fine with all of its' most popular desktop derivates. (KDE, xfce, lxde)

For the moment, the only size supported is 24px and one color scheme.
I generated all the x-cursor files and png images by hand, for the design I used Inkscape. For the links in the src directory, I used the most popular x-cursor themes on gnome-look.org.

I will be working on proper bash scripts for png and cursor generation to minimize the work. (I could probably use some help here, because I am new to bash scripting).
